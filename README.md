# lab-test
The beta test is the experimental test environment for the new features with [community program](https://medium.com/@ununifi/ununifi-community-program-ambassador-program-e0d3cfc3573e).  


## Title rule
The ideal format of Bug report has which page the bug lies in, what function it is and what happens to that function.   
For example, the style would be portal-send/bank-send/can't type amount

And for the feature request, it will be what you want it to act instead of what happens to that functoin.     
The style, for instance, would be portal-send/bank-send/gas price adjustment
